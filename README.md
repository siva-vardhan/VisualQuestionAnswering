Given a medical image accompanied with its clinically relevant question, our model is supposed to be tasked with answering the question based on the visual content. Used pretrained VGG-Net model in order to extract image features. 

The extracted image features are concatenated with the question features. These concatenated features are processed through encoder and decoder modules(both are LSTMs). 

Finally answer is generated by taking the maximum probability words from the output vector(output of decoder module).
